*Help Dot collect as many stars as she can until she can no longer continue!*

Play the game [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/739990961/)!

## Controls
Use either the left and right arrow keys or A and D to move Dot left and right.

## Scoring
* Yellow stars = 1pt
* Green stars = 5pt
* Pink stars = 10pts

*Beware the dark stars that can deplete Dot's energy!*

## Notes and Credits
* This was my first project for CS50 but ended up having a lot of fun developing it!
* A few of the mechanics were inspired by the Lemon Catch game by [@lemonnade](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Iemonnade/)
